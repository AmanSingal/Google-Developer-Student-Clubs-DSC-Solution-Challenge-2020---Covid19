InterSystems



InterSystems is the engine behind the world’s most important applications. In healthcare, finance, government, and other sectors where lives and livelihoods are at stake, InterSystems is the power behind what matters™. For resources pertaining to the Covid-19 Challenge, InterSystems is offering access to a FHIR Server and FHIR APIs through InterSystems API Manager using InterSystems IRIS for Health™.  InterSystems IRIS for Health is the world’s first and only data platform engineered specifically for the rapid development of healthcare applications to manage the world’s most critical data. It includes powerful out-of-the-box features: transaction processing and analytics, an extensible healthcare data model, FHIR-based solution development, support for healthcare interoperability standards, and more. InterSystems IRIS for Health enables developers to realize value and build breakthrough applications, fast. The HL7® FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) specification is a sanctioned standard for exchanging healthcare information. A new federal rule, issued from the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), on March 9, is poised to vastly expand innovative healthcare applications. The rule requires electronic access of all medical data, structured and/or unstructured, at no cost, through FHIR APIs.
